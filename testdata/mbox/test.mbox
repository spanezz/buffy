Enrico,

I've long been playing with ideas to make something similar to
buffy, and now you beat me to it. May I suggest the following things
for a future version?

1. It would be great if buffy could display mailboxes that have
   changed as bold and allow the user to clear the bold flag (e.g.
   middle mouse button), similar to what xbuffy does.

2. It would be great to have a mode starting with an empty list and
   then adding mailbox lines as they come in. So if I get a message
   to debian, buffy prepends (or appends, should be configurable)
   a line for the debian mailbox to the end. If I get a mail for the
   university, the uni mailbox appears above the debian mailbox. if
   now another debian mail comes in, debian moves to the top again.
   This should be configurable.

3. Can the GTK window be skinned to have it take up very little
   space on the desktop, like xbuffy? I think this would combine great
   with point 2.
  =20
4. buffy should honour mutt's mailbox settings, as i reported in the
   bug.

5. it would be great if maildirs could be scanned recursively for
   other maildirs, and the results presented in a threaded view if
   possible.

That's all for now. If I can think of other things, I will let you
know.

Great to see buffy. Thanks!

Of course, it isn't urgent, but I notice 2 minor issue:

* when commit buffy-web stuff, there was a script (suppose), that put
file online. I suppose that in recent alioth->svn switch it's wipe out.

* the "browse online" (http://svn.debian.org/viewcvs/buffy) link is
broken. Again i suppose is a side-effect from the mentioned switch.

I don't know exactly were (and if I may, with my default privilege in
alioth) put hands to fix this little (but annoying) stuff.

Hello,

I tested the new libbuffy-based buffy and added recursive scanning of
maildirs.  Together with Martin's patch and Martin's menu file, we fix
three bugs with very minimal changes, and we move to libbuffy.

I'm testing it:

 - The buffy interface works for me.
 - /usr/share/doc/python-buffy/examples/basic.py works for me.
 - basic.py with the extra features uncommented, needs extra checking,
   but that is not vital to the release.

Please have a look at it, test it, see how it goes: I think we have
enough for a release.


Ciao,

Enrico
