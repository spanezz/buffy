Of course, it isn't urgent, but I notice 2 minor issue:

* when commit buffy-web stuff, there was a script (suppose), that put
file online. I suppose that in recent alioth->svn switch it's wipe out.

* the "browse online" (http://svn.debian.org/viewcvs/buffy) link is
broken. Again i suppose is a side-effect from the mentioned switch.

I don't know exactly were (and if I may, with my default privilege in
alioth) put hands to fix this little (but annoying) stuff.
