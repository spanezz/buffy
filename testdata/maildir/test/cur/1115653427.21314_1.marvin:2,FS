Enrico,

I've long been playing with ideas to make something similar to
buffy, and now you beat me to it. May I suggest the following things
for a future version?

1. It would be great if buffy could display mailboxes that have
   changed as bold and allow the user to clear the bold flag (e.g.
   middle mouse button), similar to what xbuffy does.

2. It would be great to have a mode starting with an empty list and
   then adding mailbox lines as they come in. So if I get a message
   to debian, buffy prepends (or appends, should be configurable)
   a line for the debian mailbox to the end. If I get a mail for the
   university, the uni mailbox appears above the debian mailbox. if
   now another debian mail comes in, debian moves to the top again.
   This should be configurable.

3. Can the GTK window be skinned to have it take up very little
   space on the desktop, like xbuffy? I think this would combine great
   with point 2.

4. buffy should honour mutt's mailbox settings, as i reported in the
   bug.

5. it would be great if maildirs could be scanned recursively for
   other maildirs, and the results presented in a threaded view if
   possible.

That's all for now. If I can think of other things, I will let you
know.

Great to see buffy. Thanks!
